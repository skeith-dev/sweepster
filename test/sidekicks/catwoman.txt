Catwoman is a cat-themed criminal from Gotham City and one of Batman's most-well known enemies. Selina Kyle is often portrayed as a thief and cat burglar with divided loyalties. Her criminal activities are often tempered by a reluctant altruism, making her an inconstant villain and occasional ally to Batman. She regularly eludes capture by the Dark Knight and maintains a complicated relationship which frequently fluctuates between flirtatious to romantic. From 2002's Hush storyline, Catwoman has often been depicted as an anti-hero and one of Batman's closest allies. Several characters have also taken up the role in addition to Kyle, including Holly Robinson and Eiko Hasigawa.
